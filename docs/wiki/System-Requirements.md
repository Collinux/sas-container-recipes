## Software and Hardware Requirements

The software and hardware requirements for one or more machines (infrastructure) that you use to build and run the images are provided in this topic. 

- Two tables list the software and hardware requirements. The first table lists the requirements for the machine that is used to build the single or multiple SAS Viya images. The second table lists the requirements for the one or more machines where you will run the single or multiple SAS Viya images to launch one or more containers.
- A quick path to a containerized programming-only deployment is to use a single machine to build and run a single image. See the Run Machine table for hardware requirements.
- A containerized programming-only deployment can be built and run from a single image or multiple images.
- A containerized full deployment always requires multiple images.
- The information in this section represents what is required to start all system services and to enable a single user to operate against a small sample data set to validate operational functionality. For larger deployments, be sure to increase disck space, cores, or RAM, as necessary.
- Additional RAM should be added based on the expected quantity of data that will be processed. More resources are required for multiple-user, production-scale deployments that use large data sets. These guidelines do not attempt to account for all ordering scenarios, but instead are intended to illustrate typical software orders.

### Build Machine Requirements

The following software and hardware requirements are for the machine that is used to build single or multiple SAS Viya images.

| **Software and Hardware** | **Build a Single Image** | **Build Multiple Images** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Docker | Community Edition or Enterprise Edition, Docker 17.06 or later | Community Edition or Enterprise Edition, Docker 17.06 or later |
| Docker storage driver <sup>1</sup>  | overlay2 | overlay2 |
| Operating system | Linux, Mac <sup>2</sup> | Linux, Mac <sup>2</sup> |
| Docker registry | (Optional) Access to a Docker registry | Access to a Docker registry is required. <sup>3</sup> |  
| Disk space | Approximately 15-20 GB of free disk space in the /var/lib/docker directory | Approximately 100 GB <sup>4</sup> of free disk space in the /var/lib/docker directory | 
| Cores | 2 minimum | Programming-only deployment: 2 minimum, 4 is optimal <sup>5</sup> <br> Full deployment: 2 minimum, 10 or more is optimal <sup>4</sup>| 
| RAM | 4 GB minimum |  4 GB minimum |
| Internet access| Required | Required | 

**Notes:**

- <sup>1</sup> Use of overlay is not supported.
- <sup>2</sup> To build images on the Mac OS, Docker and the following software must be installed: [Go](https://golang.org/dl/), Java, and [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#latest-releases-on-macos).
- <sup>3</sup> The build process will push built Docker images automatically to the Docker registry. Before running build.sh, log on to docker.registry.company.com and make sure that the $HOME/.docker/config.json file is filled in correctly.
- <sup>4</sup> The disk space requirement depends on the products in the software order
- <sup>5</sup> The optimal build time occurs when the number of cores is equal to the number of containers that are being built. The number of containers varies based on your software order.

### Run Machine Requirements

The following software and hardware requirements are for the one or more machines where you will run single or mutliple images of SAS Viya to launch one or more containers.

| **Software and Hardware** | **Run a Single Image** | **Run Multiple Images** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Docker | Community Edition or Enterprise Edition, Docker 17.06 or later | Community Edition or Enterprise Edition, Docker 17.06 or later |  
| Kubernetes | (Optional) Kubernetes 1.10 or later and kubectl installed | Kubernetes 1.10 or later and kubectl installed | 
| Cores | 4 minimum |  Programming-only deployment: 6 minimum <br> Full deployment: 8 minimum  | 
| RAM | 8 GB minimum |  Programming-only deployment: 10 GB minimum <br> Full deployment: 80 GB minimum |  

## Data Source Requirements

SAS/ACCESS products and SAS In-Database Technologies products are configured to enable SAS Viya to access data sources, such as a Hadoop data store, Oracle database, PC files, and so on. Consider the following requirements to ensure that access to one or more data sources is configured correctly.

**Before you build the image:** Some data sources require configuration before you build the SAS Viya image. For example, additional SAS software is required in order to enable data retrieval from a Hadoop data store and from various data storage appliances. Depending on your software order, the image build process might include one or more SAS/ACCESS products or a SAS In-Database Technologies product. The data access software is included in the single image and the programming, computeserver, and sas-casserver-primary images. As a best practice, modify settings in the corresponding addons/access-* directory before building the images. For more information, see the following sources:

  - [Data Sources](Pre-build-Tasks#data-sources)
  - [Data Source and Storage Requirements](https://go.documentation.sas.com/?docsetId=dplyml0phy0lax&docsetTarget=n0ebm6161pdn20n1qg77ukdantd0.htm&docsetVersion=3.4) in _SAS Viya for Linux: Deployment Guide_. Search for different topics about SAS/ACCESS products and SAS In-Database Technologies products. 

**As part of the build process:** You might be required to install additional software on your CAS machines. For example, the database client must be installed in the sas-casserver-primary image. For a CAS massively parallel processing (MPP) environment, you can use the multi-node data transfer feature. For more information about the multi-node option, see [Data Connectors: Using Data Transfer Modes with Data Connectors for DBMS Data Sources](http://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=pgmsascdc&cdcVersion=9.4_3.4&docsetId=casref&docsetTarget=p12gi5eub04169n1x62tz74kvwt2.htm) in _SAS Cloud Analytic Services: Userâ€™s Guide_.

## Security Requirements

### Host Authentication

For programming-only environments (single or multiple containers), the Compute Server and CAS containers must be configured for host authentication. For more information, see [User and Group Requirements](#user-and-group-requirements).

### LDAP Requirements

LDAP is required only for a full deployment. It is not required in a programming-only deployment.

For a full deployment:

- SAS Viya must have Read access to your LDAP server.
- SAS Viya requires a userDN and password in order to bind to the LDAP server. Anonymous binding is supported for clients that are authenticating to the LDAP server.
- If the mail attribute is specified for LDAP accounts, it must have a non-null value that is unique for each user.
- LDAPS is supported, but the required certificates are not configured automatically by the deployment process.

For most user interfaces, such as SAS Drive, you configure SAS Viya to access your LDAP server after you run the image or images. For more information, see [Configure the Connection to Your Identity Provider](Post-run-Tasks#configure-the-connection-to-your-identity-provider).

### Transport Layer Security

SAS provides encryption in two contexts:

- Data at rest is data stored in databases, file servers, endpoint devices, and various storage networks. This data can be on-premises, virtual, or in the cloud. This data is usually protected in conventional ways by firewalls. Numerous layers of defense are needed, and encrypting sensitive data is another layer. You can also encrypt SAS data sets.
- Data in motion is data that is being transmitted to another location. Data is most vulnerable while in transit. Sensitive data in transit should be encrypted. You can also choose to protect all traffic in transit between servers and clients.

For a single container, see [How to Run: Docker](Build-and-Run-SAS-Viya-Single-Container#docker) for information about how to run with Transport Layer Security (TLS) enabled via Docker. For Kubernetes, see [Ingress Configuration](Pre-build-Tasks#ingress-configuration) for information about how to set up TLS.

For multiple containers, see [Ingress Configuration](Pre-build-Tasks#ingress-configuration) for information about how to set up TLS.

In this configuration, network connections from the httpproxy container to backend services are not encrypted.

## User and Group Requirements

### Requirements for the User Who Performs the Deployment

If you are using the Docker `run` command to deploy the software, create a Linux group named `docker` on the Docker host machine, and add users to it. Users that are added to this group will automatically have Read/Write ownership of the Docker process and will be able to run Docker commands without using sudo.

For more information about the `docker` group, see [https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/).

If you are using Kubernetes to deploy the software, there are no specific requirements for the deployment user.

### CAS Administrator Account Requirements

For a programming-only deployment, an administrative user is the only type of user that can log on to the CAS Server Monitor user interface in order to manage CAS settings. Therefore, a CAS administrator must be configured when the Docker image is launched. You can define a user account for the CAS administrator by specifying a user name for the CASENV_ADMIN_USER variable.

For programming-only deployments, the CAS administrator must have a valid host account. To support this requirement, SAS provides the auth-demo and auth-sssd addons that enable you to configure the running container to have valid host accounts.

**Note:** For more information about the authentication addons, see [Host Authentication](Pre-build-Tasks#host-authentication).

If you provide a different way to set up host-level authentication in the container, make sure to set the CASENV_ADMIN_USER variable to a valid user name.

For full deployments, see [Identity Management: CAS Roles](https://go.documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=calcdc&cdcVersion=3.4&docsetId=calids&docsetTarget=p1ekhq4bpia742n1lmk8ylsrtgao.htm) in _SAS Viya Administration: Identity Management_.

### User Account Requirements

- For the single Docker image and the programming, computeserver and sas-casserver-primary Docker images, here are the requirements:

  - Users must have a home directory.
  - Users must be able to authenticate via the host.
  - Users must be configured the same way across the set of running containers, which means that they should have the same user IDs, group IDs, home directories, and password.

- For a full deployment, you will configure the system for Identity Management as a post-deployment task.

**Note:** For more information about which users are used for the different images, see [Appendix: Under the Hood](https://gitlab.sas.com/sassoftware/sas-container-recipes/wikis/Appendix:-Under-the-Hood).

## Client Requirements

### Web Browsers

End users can access the product user interfaces for SAS Viya applications from a desktop computer, using a supported web browser. Because SAS software is not installed on this machine, the requirements are minimal. UNIX and 64-bit Windows operating systems are supported.

Some SAS Viya user interfaces include some advanced features that require recent versions of popular web browsers. For information about supported web browsers and the corresponding platforms to access SAS user interfaces, see [Support for Web Browsers in SAS Viya 3.4](https://support.sas.com/en/documentation/third-party-software-reference/viya/34/support-for-web-browsers.html).

### Mobile Platform and Touchscreen Support

The SAS Visual Analytics Apps run natively on iOS, Android, and Windows 10, and provide the ability to view and explore reports using a touchscreen.

Some SAS Viya user interfaces are not currently supported on mobile devices.

For more information about mobile device support, see [Support for Web Browsers in SAS Viya 3.4](https://support.sas.com/en/documentation/third-party-software-reference/viya/34/support-for-web-browsers.html).

### Database Drivers

Make sure that each client where users will access SAS software has the required database drivers already installed.

### Screen Resolution

The minimum screen resolution for each client machine that will access the SAS Viya user interfaces is 1280 x 1024.
