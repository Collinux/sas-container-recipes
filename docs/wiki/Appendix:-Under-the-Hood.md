### access-hadoop

- **Overview**

    Use the files in the addons/access-hadoop directory to smoke test SAS/ACCESS Interface to Hadoop.

    Before you build an image with the access-hadoop addon, collect the Hadoop configuration files (/config) and JAR files (/jars), and add them to this directory: [sas-container-recipes/addons/access-hadoop/hadoop](hadoop/README.md). When the Hadoop configuration and JAR files are in this directory, the files are added to a /hadoop directory in an image that includes the access-hadoop addon.

    Here is an example of the directory structure:

    ```
    sas-container-recipes/addons/access-hadoop/hadoop/config
    sas-container-recipes/addons/access-hadoop/hadoop/jars
    ```

    **Note:** To see a list of images that this addon modifies, see the addons/access-hadoop/addon_config.yml file.

- **Files**

    | **File Name** | **Purpose** |
    | --- | --- |
    | achadoop.sas | SAS code that can be submitted in SAS Studio or by the SAS batch server. The code expects the Hadoop configuration and JAR files to be available at /hadoop and uses SAS Foundation to confirm that SAS/ACCESS Interface to Hadoop is configured correctly. |
    | dchadoop.sas | SAS code that can be submitted in SAS Studio or by the SAS batch server. The code expects the Hadoop configuration and JAR files to be available at /hadoop and uses SAS Cloud Analytic Services to confirm that SAS Data Connector to Hadoop is configured correctly. |
    | addon_config.yml | This file contains the data that maps the appropriate Dockerfile or Dockerfiles to the container that it needs to modify. |

- **How To Use**

    **Note:** The achadoop.sas and dchadoop.sas tests assume that your Hadoop configuration and JAR files are located in the following location inside the container:

        - Configuration files: /hadoop/config
        - JAR files: /hadoop/jars

    - SAS Studio
        1. [Log on to SAS Studio](validating#log-on-to-your-version-of-sas-studio).

### auth-demo
- **Overview**

    This is an example about how to add a default user to a SAS Viya programming-only Docker image. The user created will also be used for the CAS Administrator and as the default user for running Jupyter Notebook if the _ide-jupyter-python3_ example is used.

    **Note:** To see a list of images that this addon modifies, see the addons/auth-demo/addon_config.yml file.

- **Files**

    | **File Name** | **Purpose** |
    | --- | --- |
    | demo_pre_deploy.sh  | A file that ends up in /tmp and will be run by the entrypoint in the script. This will create a user upon startup of the conainer.  |
    | addon_config.yml | This file contains the data that maps the appropriate Dockerfile or Dockerfiles to the container that it needs to modify. |

- **How To Use**

    When building the image, you can pass in the following arguments:

    | **Argument** | **Definition** | **Default** |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | BASEIMAGE | Define the namespace and image name to build from | sas-viya-programming |
    | BASETAG | The verision of the image to build from | latest |
    | CASENV_ADMIN_USER | The user to create | sasdemo |
    | ADMIN_USER_PASSWD | The password of the user in plain text | sasdemo |
    | ADMIN_USER_HOME | The home directory of the user |  /home/${CASENV_ADMIN_USER} |
    | ADMIN_USER_UID | The unique id of the user | 1003 |
    | ADMIN_USER_GROUP | The group name to assign the user to. It matches the "sas" group created during the deployment. | sas |
    | ADMIN_USER_GID | The ID of the group to assign the user to. It matches the "sas" group created during the deployment. | 1001 |

    Here is an example that will create a user named _foo_ with a password of _bar_, a UID of _1010_ belonging to a group with name of _widget_ and a GID of _1011_.

    ```
    docker run \
    --detach \
    --rm \
    --env CASENV_CAS_VIRTUAL_HOST=$(hostname) \
    --env CASENV_CAS_VIRTUAL_PORT=8081 \
    --env CASENV_ADMIN_USER=foo \
    --env ADMIN_USER_PASSWD=bar \
    --env ADMIN_USER_UID=1010 \
    --env ADMIN_USER_GROUP=widget \
    --env ADMIN_USER_GID=1011 \
    --publish-all \
    --publish 8081:80 \
    --name svc-auth-demo \
    --hostname svc-auth-demo \
    svc-auth-demo
    ```

- **Caveats**
    * The `root` user must run the contents of script as it is creating users and groups on startup.

### auth-sssd
- **Overview**

    This addon will install and configure System Security Service Daemon (sssd) inside some of the images. This is a way to connect the container's authentication system via the pluggable authentication module (PAM) to systems like Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) or Active Directory (AD).

    **Note:** To see a list of images that this addon modifies, see the addons/auth-sssd/addon_config.yml file.

    This addon does have support to create the user's home directory if it does not exist when a user logs into SAS Studio. However, if users need to persist content in their home directories (for example, SAS programs created from SAS Studio, or Jupyter playbooks), then it is advised to re-configure the containers so that the home directories are either :
    - mounted docker volumes when using the single image on Docker
    - persistent Volumes when using Kubernetes.

- **Files**

    | **File Name** | **Purpose** |
    | --- | --- |
    | Dockerfile | Defines the packages that need to be installed and copies other files from this directory to the image. |
    | example_sssd.conf | A file that contains a template sssd configuration, which should reflect an organization's configuration. You need to provide a valid, tested, sssd.conf for this work. |
    | sssd_mkhomedir_helper.sh | When a users's home directory does not exist, this script will create one. |
    | sssd_pre_deploy.sh | A required file that starts sssd and is called by the main entrypoint script. |
    | addon_config.yml | This file contains the data that maps the appropriate Dockerfile or Dockerfiles to the container that it needs to modify. |

- **How To Use**

    This addon will expect that there is a file in `addons/auth-sssd` directory named `sssd.conf` that reflects the organization's configuration. If it is not supplied then the `docker build` will fail. If the sssd configuration requires a TLS cert, then this can be saved as a file name sssd.cert in the `addons/auth-sssd` directory.

    When the SAS Viya container entrypoint runs, it will run the `sssd_pre_deploy.sh` script which will will launch the sssd process.

- **Caveats**
    * The `root` user must run `/usr/sbin/sssd` process
    * The sssd process is not currently logging to stdout

### ide-jupyter-python3
- **Overview**

    This is an example of how to add Jupyter Notebook with Python 3 to a SAS Viya
programming-only Docker image.

    A prerequisite is that the SAS Viya programming-only Docker
image must have already been built. It is recommended to build this on top of an image
that has host authentication (auth-demo or auth-sssd) already added.

- **How To Use**

    When building the image, you can pass in the following arguments:

    | **Argument** | **Definition** | **Default** | **Valid Values** |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | BASEIMAGE |  Define the namespace and image name to build from | sas-viya-programming |  |
    | BASETAG | The verision of the image to build from | latest |  |
    | PLATFORM | The type of host that the software is being installed on | redhat | redhat |
    | SASPYTHONSWAT | The version of [SAS Scripting Wrapper for Analytics Transfer (SWAT) package](https://github.com/sassoftware/python-swat) | 1.4.0 |
    | JUPYTER_TOKEN | The value of the token that the the notebook uses to authenticate requests. By default it is empty turning off authentication. | '' |
    | ENABLE_TERMINAL | Indicates if the terminal should be accessible by the notebook. By default it will be enabled. | True | True, False (case sensitive) |
    | ENABLE_NATIVE_KERNEL | Indicates if the python3 kernel should be accessible by the notebook. By default it will be enabled. | True | True, False (case sensitive) |

    Here is an example on how to run the image once it is built:

    ```
    docker run \
    --detach \
    --rm \
    --env CASENV_CAS_VIRTUAL_HOST=$(hostname) \
    --env CASENV_CAS_VIRTUAL_PORT=8081 \
    --publish-all \
    --publish 8081:80 \
    --name svc-ide-jupyter-python3 \
    --hostname svc-ide-jupyter-python3 \
    svc-ide-jupyter-python3
    ```

- **Persistence**
    - Users that log into SAS Studio should have their home directories persisted
    - The `/cas/data` directory is a location that is scratch space on Disk for CAS to use. You will want to point this to a fast-enough filesystem. It is likely that by leaving it as the default, it would end up hitting one of the internal docker paths, which would have neither the speed nor the space required.
    - The `/cas/permstore` directory is the location where CAS will store access permissions for caslibs. In this directory it will create a  folder based on the hostname. It is important to make sure the hostname is set the same way each time the container is run.
    - The `/cas/cache` directory is the location where CAS will cache data. The better solution for this would be to map multiple volumes to the container and set CASENV_CAS_DISK_CACHE to those mounted locations.
- **Caveats**
    - The entrypoint is running as `root`
    - The container will need some level of host authentication. The [auth-demo](#auth-demo) and [auth-sssd](#auth-sssd) provide examples of how this is supported. auth-demo will only allow one user/password combination to access the containers. so it's ok if you alone use the container. auth-sssd, once configured, allows multiple simultaneous users to access the applications.
    - The container has multiple applications running in it
    - Some process that are started in support of the application will be owned by `root`.
    - The SAS Object Spawner will start SAS Workspace Server sessions for each user that logs into SAS Studio.

## SAS Viya Full Multiple Images

The number of images in a viya-visuals build process can vary depending on ones order. The [General](#general) section will cover the information that is common to most of the images. Specific images are listed as they have specific information that is different than defined in the [General](#general) section.

### General

**Overview**

The images that fall in this category generally have two types of process running in them:
- micro-services
- SAS operational process

Each one of these images will have several micro-service processes running in them. The number can range from the single digits in to the twenties. In addition to the micro-services, there are SAS operational components that are running as well these cover:
- Consul agent
- SAS operations agent
- SAS Log Watcher
- SAS Alert agent

Processes running in these containers will pick an ephemeral port and register in Consul running in the consul pod. As services register, a process in the httpproxy pod will update the proxy.conf file and restart the httpd service. Service discover each other by querying Consul running in the consul pod.

- **Caveats**
    - The entrypoint is running as `root`
    - The container will need some level of host authentication. The [auth-demo](#auth-demo) and [auth-sssd](#auth-sssd) provide examples of how this is supported. auth-demo will only allow one user/password combination to access the containers. so it's ok if you alone use the container. auth-sssd, once configured, allows multiple simultaneous users to access the applications.

- **Persistence**
    - The `/database/data` directory is where data will be written to. This is the backend storage for the micro-services.
    - The `/opt/sas/viya/config/var/log` directory is where processes will write their logs to. It is recommended to save these logs off so that if Kubernetes pods restart that the logs can provide information to understand why.

- **Caveats**
    - The entrypoint is running as `root`
